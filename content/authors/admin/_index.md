I received a B.S. in Applied Statistics from University of Dhaka and is now pursuing a Master’s degree in Applied Statistics at the same university.
I’m a big fan of [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/), a statistical programming language.
Currently, I am working on my master's thesis project on multiple imputation topic.
