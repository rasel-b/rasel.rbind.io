> We are statisticians.
> 
> We may not be normal-
> 
> But we are transformable.
> 
> We are the "mean" lovers.
> 
> We feel complete and sufficient.
> 
> We donâ€™t accept proposals, we just fail to reject.
> 
> We do things with confidence, frequency, and variability.
> 
> We can legally comment on someone's posterior distribution.
> 
> We are always right because no one knows what we do.
> 
> We never have to say we are certain.
> 
> We get paid to make errors.
> 
> We are honestly significantly different.
