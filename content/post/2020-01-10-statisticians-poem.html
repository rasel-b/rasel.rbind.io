<blockquote>
<p>We are statisticians.</p>
<p>We may not be normal-</p>
<p>But we are transformable.</p>
<p>We are the “mean” lovers.</p>
<p>We feel complete and sufficient.</p>
<p>We don’t accept proposals, we just fail to reject.</p>
<p>We do things with confidence, frequency, and variability.</p>
<p>We can legally comment on someone’s posterior distribution.</p>
<p>We are always right because no one knows what we do.</p>
<p>We never have to say we are certain.</p>
<p>We get paid to make errors.</p>
<p>We are honestly significantly different.</p>
</blockquote>
